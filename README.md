### Pok√©dex
Each game has a different Pok√©dex (list of species available in the base game), so naturally 
the first thing to do would be to select a game first. \
The top option is just a list of all Pok√©mon that have ever been introduced

We are then lead to a list of all the relevant Pok√©mon and its forms that appear in the selected game.
From here you can search, for filter for a Pok√©mon as you desire with the given options

### Types
The Pok√©mon Type Chart can be very complex! This page makes it easier to view how a type combo matches up with the rest of the 18 Pok√©mon types

### Team Builder
In the games, you are allowed to only keep a team of 6 Pok√©mon on you at all times. Building a balanced team with minimal
and uniformly distributed weaknesses can be challenging. This feature aids you in that, allowing you to pick from a list of pokemon available in the chosen game.
User teams save to browser history and show on the landing page.

Once you select the game you want to build a team for, clicking on any Pok√©mon adds it to your team. \
From here you can give them moves, customize abilities, appearance and much more.
