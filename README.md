## Features 
Below we have snapshots into all the features this website offers with visuals

### Pok√©dex
Each game has a different Pok√©dex (list of species available in the base game), so naturally 
the first thing to do would be to select a game first. \
The top option is just a list of all Pok√©mon that have ever been introduced



We are then lead to a list of all the relevant Pok√©mon and its forms that appear in the selected game.
From here you can search, for filter for a Pok√©mon as you desire with the given options


Clicking on a specific Pok√©mon allows you to have a better look at the species, with information including:
- Biometrics
- Stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, etc)
- Type Relations (Weaknesses and Strengths)
- Abilities
- Evolutions
- Pok√©dex Entries (Descriptions)
- Learnsets (Learnable moves)

### Moves
All moves are listed as such in a grid view with the ability to search and filter as desired

Once a specific move is clicked, you can see more details about it including:
- Basic Info (Type, Class, Power, Accuracy, etc)
- Effect (What the move does)
- Descriptions
- List of Pok√©mon that can learn the move at some point

### Abilities
Similar to Moves, all abilites are listed in a similar fashion as well as the ability to search. Clicking on an ability shows more info

### Types
The Pok√©mon Type Chart can be very complex! This page makes it easier to view how a type combo matches up with the rest of the 18 Pok√©mon types

### Team Builder
In the games, you are allowed to only keep a team of 6 Pok√©mon on you at all times. Building a balanced team with minimal
and uniformly distributed weaknesses can be challenging. This feature aids you in that, allowing you to pick from a list of pokemon available in the chosen game.
User teams save to browser history and show on the landing page.
